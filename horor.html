          In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine
          Warren come out of a self-imposed sabbatical to travel to Enfield, a
          borough in north London. There, they meet Peggy Hodgson, an
          overwhelmed single mother of four who tells the couple that something
          evil is in her home. Ed and Lorraine believe her story when the
          youngest daughter starts to show signs of demonic possession. As the
          Warrens try to help the besieged girl, they become the next targets of
          the malicious spirit.</br>

          Several Midwestern teenagers fall prey to Freddy Krueger (Robert
          Englund), a disfigured midnight mangler who preys on the teenagers in
          their dreams -- which, in turn, kills them in reality. After
          investigating the phenomenon, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) begins to
          suspect that a dark secret kept by her and her friends' parents may be
          the key to unraveling the mystery, but can Nancy and her boyfriend
          Glen (Johnny Depp) solve the puzzle before it's too late?</br>
